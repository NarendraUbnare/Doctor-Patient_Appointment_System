# Doctor-Patient_Appointment_System

# Task Summary:
This SQL case study involves the Doctor-Patient Appointment System, focusing on querying and analyzing data related to doctors, patients, appointments, specialties, departments, and payments. The queries provide insights into:

Doctor workload and appointments: Find how many appointments each doctor has or the number of patients seen.
Department and specialty analysis: Understand the appointment distribution by department or specialty.
Patient behavior: Track missed appointments, total payments, and payments per appointment status.
Financial analysis: Calculate total payments for completed appointments and average payment amounts.
# Key SQL concepts used:
• JOIN (to combine data from multiple tables) • GROUP BY (to group data based on specific columns like doctor, department, or status) • COUNT() and SUM() (to calculate totals) • ORDER BY (to rank or sort data based on specific metrics) • AVG() (to calculate average payment amounts)
